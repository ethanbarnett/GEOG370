<h1>Homework 9: Rate of People Infected by COVID by Municipality in the State of Massachusetts </h1>
<h2>Ethan Barnett</h2>
<h3>This map shows the rate of people that are infected with the COVID virus by municipality in the state of Massachusetts. Since I have done all my other maps on the state, I figured I might as well continue that trend and make another. The reaosn I decided to do a choropleth on the virus is because it is something I really would like gone. I personally take all precautions that I need to, but I was curious to see what the rates were looking like in another state. I also decided to go with a data set that included cities rather than counties because I wanted more detail in the map. There are only 12 counties in the state of Massachusetts, so I felt it would be a lot more benificial to see the data set expressed with finer detail to be able to see the true rate of infection for the state. </h3>
