Points:
1. My first two points were on the bottom of the map, on the Dean Smith Center. I had one on the left upper corner and the other on the right lower corner.
2. My third and fourth points were on the left upper corner of Ehringhaus Residence Hall, and the right lower corner of the same residence hall.
3. My fifth point was on the road just above Craige North Residence Hall, in the uppermost left corner of the four way intersection of the road.
4. My sixth point is on the road of William Blythe Drive. On this road, right above the T junction, I set a point on the left upper corner of this junction (on the road).
5. My seventh and eighth points were on the very back of the Kenan Memorial Stadium. They were on the left bottom corner of the building that lies behind the stadium and the uppermost corner of the stands closest to that previous point.
