<h1>Homework 10: Airports In & Around the Boston Area in the State of Massachusetts</h1>
<h2>Ethan Barnett</h2>
<h3>The question I asked myself for this assignment was "How many airports are there in and around the Boston area, and how many different roads connect the airport/s to the city. The reason I wanted to ask this question is because when I moved back to the USA after years of growing up in South Africa, the Boston International Airport is the airport I landed at to start my new life here. I was interested in finding out if there were many other airports in the area. After using the vector data that I got from the State site, I came to the comclusion that there were only two other airports close to the area surrounding Boston. When I added the road vector, I found that there were a lot less roads leading to the airport than I had originally thought. I believe the reason for this is because the airport is on a little piece of land almost separated from the state itself. I found that after you travel along the road away from the airport that there is a very confusing network of roads that join the city and the surrouding areas. To geo-process, I used two different methods: A buffer for the airports, and two dissolves to separate the Boston area from the rest of the state and separate the roads in Boston from those outside of the area." </h3>
